    This page should be developed by Craig and should be accessed @ "docs.fd.io".

    This sphinx version is only so we can visualize the layout of the links. The
    final version can be in whatever you think is appropriate.

    The text is somewhat accurate. Any comments are welcome.

The Linux Foundation FD.io project is comprised of several projects. The Vector Packet
Processor (VPP) project is the core technology. The Continuous System Integration
and Test (CSIT) project is used for system test. The other projects take advantage of
these projects.

The project documentation for each project can be found here.
